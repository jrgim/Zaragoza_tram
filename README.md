# **Zaragoza Tram**

Welcome to the **Zaragoza Tram** integration for Home Assistant! This integration allows you to create sensors that show the remaining time for the next two trams to arrive at a specific stop in Zaragoza.
This integration obtains the data thanks to the API made available by the Zaragoza City Council. [API REST Zaragoza](https://www.zaragoza.es/sede/portal/datos-abiertos/servicio/catalogo/327)
